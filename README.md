# Solo-Project-Chess-App
Using JS, React-Redux, Node, and Express /\\/ Socket.io will now be a strech feature /\\/ 

This is a Solo Project for Codesmith

1. Identify your user(s)
Fellow Developers, learning react / redux, and Chess players / older browsers with lack support for advanced / modern features

2. What is the problem you’re solving?
The APP i’ll create is presumably going to be using more “up-to-date” code structure /\\/ and integrating state which others of its genre don't seem to define well or use /\\/  this is now a strech feature /\\/

3. What is the solution?
   implementing " Modern React " and a State Paradigm, instead of using "Legacy React"

5. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)
/\\/ express / socket.io => APP => Players(Multi-State) => Board render(state) => pieces => functionality(reducers) /\\/ revised and re-Scoped /\\/
Server-Side-Rendering -> Modern React(18) -> state to manage Dynamic rendering -> game functionality

7. What are the tough technical challenges involved with solving this problem?
webpack took me almsot all day to configure,
in the process i soon learned of my "real" focus which was using an SSR to enable me to..
A. target my goals, 
B. handle React, 
C. configure Webpack more easily
D. enable a stable enviroment to test / implement my code process after initial set-up 

8. What are the stretch goals?
integrating Socket.io,
game Functionality,
Implementing Jotai to enable Multi State to allow Easier POV of rendering the Board, and to enable previous Logs of moves made,
I would also like to; After the user has signed in / logged in, to prompt a Room choice / invite / create multiple rooms, going at once,
In each room, have a UI for the Game, Chat, Player Icon etc..
Outside of PVP I would like to implement an AI to play against and/or have an AI “teach” you the game.
