# Solo-Project-Chess-App
Using JS, React-Redux, Node, Express, and Socket.io  

This is a Solo Project for Codesmith

1. Identify your user(s)
Fellow Developers, learning react / redux, and Chess players :D

2. What is the problem you’re solving?
The APP i’ll create is presumably going to be using more “up-to-date” code structure, and integrating state which others of its genre don't seem to define well / use.

3. What is the solution?
   implementing " Modern React " and a State Paradigm, instead of using "Legacy React"

5. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)
express / socket.io => APP => Players(Multi-State) => Board render(state) => pieces => functionality(reducers) 

7. What are the tough technical challenges involved with solving this problem?
Implementing Socket.io with react / redux, and possibly Jotai

8. What are the stretch goals?
Implementing Jotai to enable Multi State to allow Easier POV of rendering the Board, and to enable previous Logs of moves made. I would also like to; After the user has signed in / logged in, to prompt a Room choice / invite / create multiple rooms, going at once.
In each room, have a UI for the Game, Chat, Player Icon etc..
Outside of  PVP I would like to implement an AI to play against and/or have an AI “teach” you the game.
